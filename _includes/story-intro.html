<p>Xorro P2P is a mini BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing network built by software engineers Ken Chen, <a href="http://davidkurutz.github.io/" target="_blank">David Kurutz</a>, and Terry Lee.</p> 

<p>Due to an interest in P2P networks and distributed systems, we set out to build our own from scratch. The version available today is our alpha release, providing a working proof-of-concept. We want to continue improving upon Xorro and we list upcoming features further down this page.</p>
 
<p>This site outlines our journey building Xorro P2P. We hope that readers leave with a better understanding of the P2P problem space.</p>
